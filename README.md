# Welcome to the Design Portal V3

> this is a "v-next" of the Design Portal and is a work in progress

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

As this is an Astro project, it should adhere to the following Astro best practices:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, should be placed in the `public/` directory.

**When adding a new page**, you _must_ add an exported `title` and `description`. This is what the "Search" component uses to populate itself.
