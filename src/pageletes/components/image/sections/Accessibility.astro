  <Description>
    When using images, it is important to ensure that all users can understand,
    navigate and interact with the content. Accessibility means that we must
    design and build with all types of users in mind, including those with
    physical, motor or mental impairment.

    <SubHeader id="image-alternative-text">Alternative Text</SubHeader>

    <Description>
      Alternative Text is embedded into the code. It provides a concise
      description of the important elements of each image. Alt text should
      convey the purpose and meaning of the image and how it relates to what is
      happening in the user interface.
    </Description>

    <Description>
      Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely upon alt text to
      describe the image and meaning to users. Employ clear and specific
      language, and avoid vague or redundant descriptions.
    </Description>

    <Description>
      Be sure to include all relevant information from the image in the alt
      text. If the color of a personâ€™s shirt is not relevant to the situation,
      it can safely be left out of the alt text.

  <PageleteSubSection>
    <SubHeader id="image-decorative-images">Decorative Images</SubHeader>

    <Description>
      If an image is purely decorative and conveys no meaningful information,
      such as a company logo, leave the alt text field empty. You can also use
      the aria-hidden attribute to indicate that the image should be ignored by
      screen readers. This helps to reduce clutter and allows assistive
      technologies to focus on important content.
