<Description>
  Table sticky column is a feature that allows a specific column within a table
  to remain visible as the user scrolls horizontally through the table. This can
  be especially useful when working with large tables that have many columns, as
  it allows the user to always see the important columns without having to
  manually scroll back and forth.
