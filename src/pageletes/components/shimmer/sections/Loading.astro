  <Description>
    Progressive loading is a technique that loads pages in batches. The simplest
    view of the page loads first, followed by progressively more detailed
    batches until the entire viewport has loaded.

  <ColumnLayout bkgColor="white" numOfColumns={1}>
    <Image src={progressiveLoadingImage} alt={progressiveLoadingImgAltText} />
  </ColumnLayout>
  <Description>
    The primary batch should show a pageâ€™s basic structure (the skeleton state
    versions of the container-based components), data-based text (the skeleton
    state version of text) and non-data text. Following batches can include
    images, content outside of the viewport, interactive (action-based)
    components, and data-based text.
