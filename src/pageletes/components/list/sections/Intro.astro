  <Description>
    A List component in UI design is an interface element that displays a
    collection of items or data in a linear arrangement. It can display data in
    different formats, such as text, images, or combinations. The purpose of a
    list is to provide users with an organized and efficient way to access and
    navigate through a large amount of information. Examples of list components
    are drop-down menus, navigation menus, data tables, and ordered/unordered
    collections.
