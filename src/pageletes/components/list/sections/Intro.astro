  <Description>
    A list component in UI design is an interface element that displays a collection of items or data in a linear arrangement.
     It can display data in different formats, such as text, images, or a combination of both. The purpose of a list component
      is to provide users with an organized and efficient way to access and navigate through a large amount of information.
     Some examples of list components are drop-down menus, navigation menus, data tables, and ordered/unordered lists.
