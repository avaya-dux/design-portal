  <Description>
    Notifications do not dismiss automatically. They persist on the page until
    the user dismisses them or takes action that resolves the notification.

  <ImageWrapper padding="0" marginBottom="3rem">
    <Image src={dismissalOne.src} alt={dismissalOneAltText} />
  </ImageWrapper>

  <Description>
    A small “x” is used to dismiss notifications. Including the close button is
    optional and should not be included if it is critical for a user to read or
    interact with the notification.
