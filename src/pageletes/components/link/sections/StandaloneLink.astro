  <Description>
    A Standalone Link can appear anywhere on the page that is not embedded into
    text (in a sentence or paragraph). It exists independently, such as in a
    table of contents, a list, or a directory.
  </Description>
  <Description>
    Standalone links are not underlined as that can make them difficult to read
    when grouped together into tables of contents or lists, etc. Icons cannot be
    attached to a Standalone link.

          The default state of the Standalone link is blue text without any
          underlining.

        <InfoTableCell>
          When the user moves focus onto the link, it becomes underlined.
          Selecting the link in this state will jump the user to the specified
          location.

        <InfoTableCell>
          A link that is disabled appears on the page, but is currently
          unavailable. For example, when something has to happen (i.e. create a
          user name, fill in a field) before the link becomes active.

  <SubHeader id="standalone-link-with-icon">Link with Icon</SubHeader>
  <Description>
    Standalone links can include an icon either in front of or at the end of the
    text. Only use icons for links that are for functions rather than for
    navigation. The icon must be representative of the action provided by the
    link.
  </Description>
  <Description>
    For accessibility, aria-text must be included that explains where the link
    goes, and also if there are associated actions, such as to download a PDF
    file, or go to a data entry screen.

  <Description>
    Use a Standalone link whenever you need to provide navigation options that
    are not embedded into other text. Make sure that the link text is
    descriptive of where the user will be taken once selected.
