  <Description>
    Light and dark modes are color schemes used to display the user interface.
    Other elements on the screen, such as icons and buttons, may also be changed
    by the theme to ensure that they are still accessible and visible to all
    users. Images are not affected by the theme.

  <PageleteSubSection>
    <SubHeader id="theme-light-mode">Light Mode</SubHeader>

    <Description>
      Characterized by a light or white background throughout, the Light theme
      has dark, contrasting text and other UI elements. Light mode creates a
      clean look that can be particularly effective in apps or websites with
      lots of text.

  <PageleteSubSection>
    <SubHeader id="theme-dark-mode">Dark Mode</SubHeader>

    <Description>
      The Dark theme features a dark background, with contrasting light text and
      other UI elements. It helps to reduce eye strain in low-light
      environments, and is often preferred when working from devices.
