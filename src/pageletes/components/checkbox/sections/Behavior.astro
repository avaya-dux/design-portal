  <Description>
    A checkbox is used to allow the user to select one or more options from a
    list. The icon varies in appearance according to the current state of the
    item or list.
  </Description>

  <Description>
    Checkbox items can be stacked in an hierarchical structure. Higher level
    items can have multiple items within it. These sub-items can also have other
    stacked list items within them. If only a single item can ever be selected
    at one time, use a Radio instead.
