<SubHeader id="select-behavior-chips">Chips</SubHeader>

<Description>
  When multiple selections are allowed, and a combobox is being used, the
  selected items appear as chips within the field. Clicking the X within a chip,
  or deselecting the checkbox in the list will deselect that item.

<Description>
  Where space allows, a combobox can be set to display the chips wrapped onto
  multiple rows. If space is limited, chips can appear on a single row with a
  chip specifying how many additional hidden items are selected. Clicking the
  number opens the dropdown menu to display all of the selected items.
