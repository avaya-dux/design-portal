  <PageTitle>Design Tokens</PageTitle>

  <Description>
    Design tokens are the foundational elements of Neo. They are named entities
    that store design attribute information, and are used instead of hard-coded
    values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) to
    maintain a scalable and consistent visual appearance.
