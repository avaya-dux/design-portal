		The Sheet component has been discontinued and is no longer supported. It has
		been replaced by the Drawer, which offers similar functionality.
		Alternatively, you can use the Modal component to achieve similar results.
		Please select the option that best suits your needs.

					>A drawer component slides in from the right edge of the screen. It
					overlays the main content with a scrim and provides a space for
					secondary content or actions. Drawers are often used for menus,
					settings, or any extra content without taking up the entire screen.

				<InfoTableCell
					>A modal overlays the main content, temporarily disabling interaction
					with the rest of the page with a scrim until the user engages with it.
					Typically used to display important information or require a decision,
					modals block further use of the app until the user acknowledges the
