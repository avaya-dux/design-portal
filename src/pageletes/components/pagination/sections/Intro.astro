  <Description>
    Pagination is a technique used to divide large amounts of table data into
    smaller, easier to manage blocks. Pagination improves usability of tables by
    reducing the amount of information presented to the user at one time. For longer
		pages, opt for pagination instead of infinite scrolling. Pagination ensures
		content is easily trackable and always visible, enhancing accessibility.
