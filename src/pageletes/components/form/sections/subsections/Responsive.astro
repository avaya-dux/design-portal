  <Description>
    Forms should be designed to with a single column. Horizontal stacking should
    only occur when space is limited, or when there are 2 or more fields that
    are related (e.g. city and zip code). When adding a form to a page, be sure
    to follow the Layout guidelines for responsive breakpoints, margins and
    gutters.
