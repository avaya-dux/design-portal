  <Description>
    Alignment refers to the arrangement of input fields and labels on a form so that they are visually consistent
     and easy to read. Proper form alignment is important to create clear and intuitive visual designs that guide
      users through a process.

  <Description>
    Align forms and input components to the left side of the page layout keeping all inputs the same width.
     Fields should be stacked vertically where possible, but related items (e.g.  Start Date, End Date) can
     be stacked horizontally.
