  <CaptionInfoList>
    <InfoListItem label="Section Header">
      The title of this form. It tells the user what this section is about and
      the sort of information that may be required.
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Required Field">
      A field label that ends with an asterisk * signifies that this field must
      be filled in by the user before they can proceed to the next screen.
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Error Text Field">
      When the system detects a problem with the data entered, the border around
      the field will turn red.
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Error Helper Text">
      When the system detects a problem with the data entered, an error message
      is placed beneath the field with the problem. The error text should
      indicate what the problem is and, where possible, how to fix it.
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Optional Field">
      A field label that does not end with an asterisk is optional. The user can
      leave this field blank if they choose.
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Checkbox">
      A checkbox can be used to allow the user to opt-in to a feature of the
      program (e.g. subscription, provide feedback, etc.). In this case, it is
      optional. Checkboxes can also be used to verify that a user has read the
      legal text, or otherwise understands what is about to happen(e.g. data
      collection).
    </InfoListItem>

    <InfoListItem label="Action Buttons">
      Once all of the required information has been entered into the form, the
      user can select Submit to pass the information to the system for
      processing. Cancel will clear the data from the form and return the user
      to the previous screen.
    </InfoListItem>
