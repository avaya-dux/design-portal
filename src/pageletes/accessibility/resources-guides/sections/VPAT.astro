  <Description>
    A VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) is a blank form that lists
    all of the WCAG requirements. The developer fills in the blanks to show the
    compliance status of a particular product. When the VPAT has been completed,
    it is referred to as an ACR (Accessibility Compliance Report). ACRs are used
    by buyers to determine how accessible a product is and where any potential
    deficiencies are. An ACR may be required by a buyer, either by law or by
    company policy, before a purchase is made.

    The WCAG (Web Component Accessibility Guidelines) regulations are managed by
    the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and represent the worldwide standard for
    accessibility.
