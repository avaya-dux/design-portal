  <Description>
    A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a document prepared by
    a manufacturer that gives information about the degree to which a particular
    product complies with WCAG 2.1 and Section 508 links for accessibility.
    VPATs are used by federal agencies, governments and other clients to assess
    accessibility when performing market research and evaluating proposals.

    The WCAG (Web Component Accessibility Guidelines) regulations are managed by
