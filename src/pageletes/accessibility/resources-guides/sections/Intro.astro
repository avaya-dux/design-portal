    Accessibility checklists provide a simple method for checking if your UI is
    free of barriers for people with disabilities. While there are many
    effective methods to improve accessibility, an accessibility checklist has
    great appeal because it is easy to understand and use. The checklist covers
    the most common website accessibility problems and guides you to a
    resolution.
