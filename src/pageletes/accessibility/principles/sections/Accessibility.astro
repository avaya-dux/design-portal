  <Description>
    In addition to helping users with disabilities, accessible design helps
    provide better user experiences for everyone. A text description included in
    an image makes its content available to a user who is blind, and makes it
    possible for search engines to index the image.

  <Description>
    Using Neo components improves accessibility and consistency when building
    UX/UI solutions. However, the way Neo is used can affect the accessibility
    of the application. Be sure to include testing in the design and development
    process to avoid any accessibility barriers and delays due to fixing the
    problems before release.
