  <Description>
    Screen readers are a text-to-speech engine used by people who are visually
    impaired or blind to hear spoken descriptions of the content of the
    screen/application. Testing with screen readers enables designers and
    developers to evaluate the content from their perspective. This helps to
    catch mistakes that are otherwise difficult to spot visually, and can help
    identify structural problems such as reading order, table markup and form
    elements.
