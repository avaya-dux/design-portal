  <Description>
    We have a large collection of icons available to handle almost any
    situation. Some icons may need to be mirrored horizontally for right-to-left
    languages (such as Arabic and Hebrew). To see the icons that this can apply
    to, enable the bidirectionality checkbox below. Apply bidirectionality by
    adding dir=”rtl” on the span. To learn more, see bidirectionality
    guidelines.
