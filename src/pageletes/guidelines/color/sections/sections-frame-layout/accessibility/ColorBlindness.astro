    Color blindness (also known as Color Vision Deficiency) affects
    approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. There are
    different forms of color blindness in which people have difficulty
    distinguishing certain colors, with extremely rare cases of those who cannot
    see color at all. The most common forms of color blindness are
    Deuteranomaly/Deuteranopia (green weak/blind), which affects 6% of men, and
    Protanomaly/Protanopia (red weak/blind), which affects another 2%.
    Tritanomaly/Tritanopia (blue weak/blind) is very rare, affecting less than
    0.001% of men.
