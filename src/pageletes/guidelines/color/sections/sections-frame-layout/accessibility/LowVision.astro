    Low vision is often referred to as "partially sighted" and “sight impaired.”
    It is estimated that approximately 246 million people worldwide have some
    level of vision impairment. The level of impairment varies from
    person-to-person and can include: visual acuity (clarity/sharpness of
    vision), light sensitivity, contrast sensitivity, and field of vision (the
    area one can see when their eyes are focused in one place).
