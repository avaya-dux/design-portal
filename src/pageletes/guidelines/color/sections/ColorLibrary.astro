  <Description>
    Our color library helps ensure that the colors used in an interface are
    accessible, harmonious, and effective at communicating the intended message.
    They are also selected to match the Avaya branding guidelines.

  <Description>
    Neo has 5 functional colors used to communicate meaning, such as errors,
    warnings, success, etc. Each color contains 9 variants to provide
    flexibility in design, support for light and dark modes, and sufficient
    contrast for accessibility (see below for more information). See Design
    Tokens for guidance on platform specific usage.

  <Description>
    Neo also has a base grayscale consisting of 11 variants used to create a
    visual hierarchy throughout the interface - white, black and equivalent
    levels as functional colors. The grays are neutral to ensure they do not
    distract users from the main focus when completing tasks. They should be
    used across all other elements on the interface, including text,
    backgrounds, borders and sections.
