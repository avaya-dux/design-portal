  <Description>
    The improper use of color can create barriers for users with color blindness
    or low vision. Users that are color-blind struggle to differentiate between
    some colors, while those with low vision experience difficulties viewing an
    interface.

      Color blindness (also known as Color Vision Deficiency) affects
      approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. There are different forms of
      color blindness in which people have difficulty distinguishing certain
      colors, with extremely rare cases of those who cannot see color at all.
      The most common forms of color blindness are Deuteranomaly/Deuteranopia
      (green weak/blind), which affects 6% of men, and Protanomaly/Protanopia
      (red weak/blind), which affects another 2%. Tritanomaly/Tritanopia (blue
      weak/blind) is very rare, affecting less than 0.001% of men.

      Low vision is often referred to as "partially sighted" and “sight
      impaired.” It is estimated that approximately 246 million people worldwide
      have some level of vision impairment. The level of impairment varies from
      person-to-person and can include: visual acuity (clarity/sharpness of
      vision), light sensitivity, contrast sensitivity, and field of vision (the
      area one can see when their eyes are focused in one place).

    To help people with these issues, colors should be used as follows.

  <InfoList type="decimal" fontSize="16px">
    <InfoListItem>
      Use color with other visual means of communication.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Color alone should not be used to convey information as the content may
      not be apparent to those with color blindness or low vision. Color should
      be combined with other elements, such as labels or shapes. In addition to
      making it easily legible, it also makes items quicker to process for those
      with normal vision.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Use sufficient contrast between elements. Navy blue text on a black
      background is hard for anyone to read.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      To ensure the interface is clearly legible for all users, use these rules
      when applying colors to text and UI elements. These apply to all colors at
      the same level (e.g. Red-100 is equivalent to Blue-100, Green-100, etc.).
      Note that decorative items (such as branding images) do not need to meet
      this requirement.
