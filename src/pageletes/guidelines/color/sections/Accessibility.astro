  <Description>
    The improper use of color can create barriers for users with color blindness
    or low vision. Users that are color blind struggle to differentiate between
    some colors, while those with low vision experience difficulties viewing an
    interface.

  <Description>
    To help people with these issues, colors should be used as follows.

      Use color with other visual means of communication.

      Color alone should not be used to convey information as the content may
      not be apparent to those with color blindness or low vision. Color should
      be combined with other elements, such as labels or shape. In addition to
      making it easily legible, it also makes items quicker to process for those
      with normal vision.

      Use sufficient contrast between elements. Navy blue text on a black
      background is hard to anyone to read.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem  >
      To ensure the interface is clearly legible for all users, use these rules
      when applying colors to text and UI elements. These apply to all colors at
      the same level (e.g. Red-100 is equivalent to Blue-100, Green-100, etc.).
      Note that decorative items (such as branding images) do not need to meet
      this requirement.
