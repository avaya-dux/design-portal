  <Description>
    With Avayaâ€™s globe spanning customer base, we can never be certain which
    operating system or web browser the customer will be using. There are
    multiple options in both categories, and our designs need to be built to
    work with all combinations. Each platform has its own limitations and
    idiosyncrasies that may affect the user experience.
