  <Description>
    Here are a few additional points to keep in mind when designing a UI:
  </Description>

  <InfoList type="disc">
    <InfoListItem>
      Keep it relevant and to the point. You don't need to talk about what is
      going on behind the scenes. Just tell them what to do now to keep moving
      forward. Provide a simple, direct and obvious path to the solution - Tell
      them what they need to do. Tell them what they are looking at. Tell them
      what went wrong.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      You should always Lead, don't Push, Show, don't Assume, Ask, don't Demand.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Start with the most important thing at the top. The somewhat important
      comes next. Lastly are the extra bits, the least important. People won't
      read it all so make your point at the start.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Never be vague or uncertain. “Do this” rather than “Try this.”
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Never accuse. The error is not their fault. Help them fix it, don't blame
      them for it.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Don't skip steps or jump ahead. YOU may know the procedure but they don't.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Have fun with it. If you are enjoying it, so will the reader.
    </InfoListItem>
  </InfoList>
