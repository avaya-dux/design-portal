  <Description>
    To create the best experience for our customers, we must follow a few simple
    rules:
  </Description>

  <InfoList type="disc">
    <InfoListItem>
      Your writing should read like a conversation with a friend. Write the
      script, then read it aloud to yourself. If it can be heard as angry,
      self-righteous or domineering, then change it. If, however, it feels like
      you are talking to a friend, then you have it right. The more like a
      conversation it is, the less the user must be taught.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Be fun, friendly, helpful and relaxed. Keep it light.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Keep it simple and intuitive. Use common language. Our customers are very
      clever, but they are not all technical specialists. Use words that
      everyone can understand. Keep it accessible.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Be positive. Say what can be done, not what can't, and then show them how.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Keep it short. Don't lose your audience by talking too much. Provide only
      the necessary information. Each sentence should average 15-20 words - give
      directions, not options.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      But don't make it too short. The goal is to make things easy for the
      reader. Make it as short as you can, but take it as long as you need to be
      effective.
