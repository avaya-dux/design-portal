  <Description>
    We have talked about setting the mood for the end-user, but there are still
    some mechanical aspects of writing we must use.

      Use the Active Voice. It is the reader that does the action, not the
      action is done by the reader - "(You) Push the Save button" Not "The Save
      button must now be pushed (by you)".
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Be consistent. Use the same words and procedure for the same thing
      whenever it appears. How many ways are there to print a document in
      MSWord? Pick one and use it every time.
    </InfoListItem>
    <InfoListItem>
      Parts of Speech. Metaphor is like the plague, something to be avoided.
      Colloquialisms are also out the window. No jargon, euphemisms or clich√©s
      either.
