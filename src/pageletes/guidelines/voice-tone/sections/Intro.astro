  <Description>
    The goal of Avaya is to create “Experiences that Matter” for all users. For
    most customers, that will be most strongly felt through the interface of our
    products. When they sit down to use our applications, they see the UI that
    we created. How that is realized will determine to a large extent the way it
    makes them feel. Your job is to lead the customer where they want to go,
    even if you don’t know where that is at the start.

    This guide defines our philosophy for the writing that you must build into
    the content you create. How you write the text, and how it is presented to
    the user will strongly influence their experience so we must get it right.
    The UI creates the UX.
