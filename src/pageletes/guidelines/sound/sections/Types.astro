  <Description>
    There are two types of sound available in the UI: audio tones and speech.
    Each communicates different things, and may be used together depending on
    the context.

    >
      Speech output can communicate information that tones alone cannot, such as
      conversations. For example, the Avaya SpacesÂ® dial-in menu when joining a
      space via telephone.

      Shorter sounds, such as notification alerts and dial tones, are used most
      frequently in applications.
