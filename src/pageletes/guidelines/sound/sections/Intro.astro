  <Description>
    Sound can be used as a way to communicate additional information in a UI. It
    enhances the overall experience and provides some personality to the
    application.
  </Description>

  <Description>
    Sound should never be used by itself, but must always be used in conjunction
    with other components. For example, an audio file playback should be
    accompanied by a transcription or subtitles for people with impaired
    hearing.
