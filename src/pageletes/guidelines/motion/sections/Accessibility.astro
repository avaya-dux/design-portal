    Some users may be motion sensitive. Ensure that applications respect the
    userâ€™s preferences, and avoid complicated and unnecessary animations.

      captionTitle="Support Reduced Motion"
    >
      Users with motion sensitivities can activate a feature that requires
      applications to minimize the use of non-essential motion. This includes
      large page transitions and animated illustrations.

      captionTitle="Avoid Large Scale Animations"
    >
      Large animations, such as parallax scrolling, can trigger dizziness,
      nausea and headaches for those with vestibular disorders. Avoid using
      animations altogether. You must, at least, provide an option to turn the
      animations off.
