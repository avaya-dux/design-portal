  <Description>
    Every written language has its own set of characters known as glyphs. For
    each language that a UI can display, the typography layout should adapt as
    languages vary in average word length and height. To determine which font
    family to use for each language, refer to the <a
      class="neo-link neo-link__inline"
      href="#fixme">typography section</a
    >.

  <Description>
    Avaya currently supports 10 languages: English, French, Spanish, German,
    Italian, Russian, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
    Additional languages can be added via a request for each project region.
