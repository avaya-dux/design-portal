  <Description>
    Typography refers to the way that text is styled and presented to make it
    legible and appealing when displayed. Typography enforces hierarchy in the
    user interface and can express a brand presence. Using typography
    consistently encourages unified experiences across Avaya products, and
    ensures that text is accessible to all.
