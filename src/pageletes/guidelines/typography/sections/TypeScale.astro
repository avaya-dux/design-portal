  <Description>
    Neo uses a different font depending on the language. For Avayaâ€™s officially
    supported languages, Neo uses the <ExternalLink
      inline
      href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans"
    >
      Noto Sans font
    </ExternalLink> provided by Google. This ensures that the font is legible to
    all users, and provides a character set for various languages for free. Noto
    Sans has been tested for use in multiple languages, and satisfies the WCAG
    regulations for accessibility.
