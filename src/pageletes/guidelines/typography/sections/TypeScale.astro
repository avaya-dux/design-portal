  <Description>
    Neo uses a different font depending on the language. For Avayaâ€™s officially
    supported languages, Neo uses the Noto Sans JP font provided by Google. This
    ensures that the font is legible to all users, and provides a character set
    for various languages for free. Noto Sans JP has been tested for use in
    multiple languages, and satisfies the WCAG regulations for accessibility.

    This interactive table shows how the fonts are displayed with regard to
    size, weight, and style. Use the design tokens to ensure the correct values
    are employed. If you need a language that is not listed, please reach out to
    us for guidance.
