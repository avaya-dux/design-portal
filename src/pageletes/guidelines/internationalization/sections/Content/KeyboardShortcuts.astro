    Keyboard Shortcuts

  <Description>
    Many languages have their own keyboard layouts for their most common
    characters. Some languages can have several layouts. Any shortcuts you
    create must consider how these actions can be triggered in each language.

      Most languages use a modifier key such as AltGr (known as the right
      Alt/option key on a U.S. English keyboard) to enter additional letters,
      diacritics or symbols. To avoid clashing with shortcuts that use Alt, make
      sure the application differentiates between these 2 keys. On the web, this
      can be achieved by checking the .key attribute instead of .keycode.

      Providing users with a mechanism to override embedded shortcuts with their
      own is a great way to alleviate conflicts between languages and allows
      users to select the configuration that is most comfortable for them. Where
      possible, allow users to define their own shortcuts within an application.
